To pruduce results run this build requires an in-tree build with gcc
configured to include coverage data. Use the -c option to run configure
with the right options, and run "make clean all check" to fully prepare
the build. Running without arguments shows results for all source files
in the configured directories.

Each file is covered by a test derived from it's name. For example the
following file:

rulesets/Character.cpp

should be covered by;

tests/Charactertest.cpp

To see line by line data, run this script on Character.cpp only:

./scripts/run_coverage_tests.sh rulesets/Character.cpp

and the line by line report will be in this file:

rulesets/Character.cpp.gcov
